Notes: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1Totals may differ across portfolio reports due to rounding and the timing of the data runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Data is run at the end of the corresponding federal fiscal year or at the end of each quarter listed by federal fiscal year. Each federal fiscal year begins October 1 and ends September 30. Q1 ends 12/31, Q2 ends 3/31, Q3 ends 6/30, and Q4 ends 9/30.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Recipient is the student that benefits from the federal student loan. In most cases, the recipient is the borrower, but in parent PLUS loans, the parent is the borrower and their child is the recipient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4  Recipient counts are based at the loan level. As a result, recipients may be counted multiple times across varying loan statuses. Stafford (Combined) is the total of Stafford Subsidized and Stafford Unsubsidized and includes a unique Stafford recipient count. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
