BEA Regions are a set of Geographic Areas that are aggregations of the states. The regional classifications, which were developed in the mid-1950s, are based on the homogeneity of the states in terms of economic characteristics, such as the industrial composition of the labor force, and in terms of demographic, social, and cultural characteristics. BEA groups all 50 states and the District of Columbia into eight distinct regions for purposes of data collecting and analyses.  IPEDS/HEGIS assigns U.S. service schools as their own region.

The 2021 update includes only minor changes. Specifically, the label “Tribal Colleges” has been changed back?to “Tribal Colleges and Universities”. In addition, there is a newly created category “Special Focus Research?Institution”, comprised of the special focus?institutions?that meet the criteria for being considered a “Research University” but confer degrees in a limited range of academic programs. Additionally, the special focus categories of “Engineering Schools” and “Other Technology-Related Schools” have been combined into a single category.

R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity
D/PU: Doctoral/Professional Universities

Master's Colleges and Universities - Generally includes institutions that awarded at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees during the update year (with occasional exceptions – see Methodology). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Baccalaureate Colleges - Includes institutions where baccalaureate or higher degrees represent at least 50 percent of all degrees but where fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees were awarded during the update year. (Some institutions above the master's degree threshold are also included; see Methodology.) Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Baccalaureate/Associate's Colleges - Includes four-year colleges (by virtue of having at least one baccalaureate degree program)  that conferred more than 50 percent of degrees at the associate's level. Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

Associate's Colleges - Institutions at which the highest level degree awarded is an associate's degree. The institutions are sorted into nine categories based on the intersection of two factors: disciplinary focus (transfer, career & technical or mixed) and dominant student type (traditional, nontraditional or mixed). Excludes Special Focus Institutions and Tribal Colleges.

The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.

Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as ""the 1890 land-grants.""  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the ""1994 land-grants.""

A CBSA is a geographic entity consisting of the county or counties associated with at least one core (urbanized area or urban cluster) of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core.  Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are the two categories of Core Based Statistical Areas.

Metropolitan Statistical Area - A Core Based Statistical Area associated with at least one urbanized area that has a population of at least 50,000. 

Micropolitan Statistical Area - A Core Based Statistical Area associated with at least one urban cluster that has a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000.

15230,DFRCGID,"Data Feedback Report comparison group category. - This indicator was used to create the automatic comparison groups in the IPEDS Data Feedback Report, when institutions did not provide their own comparison group. 

All institutions that participated in Title IV federal financial aid programs were first separated into degree-granting and nondegree-granting groups by control of institution (public, private not-for-profit and private for-profit). 

Degree-granting institutions were divided into the following groups using the institution category variable: graduate and 4-year primarily baccalaureate and above; 4-year primarily associate's; and 2-year degree-granting. The Carnegie Classification Basic 2021 was then used further classify degree-granting institutions within the 4 groups. The highest degree offered was used for 4-year degree-granting institutions that did not have a carnegie classification. 

The majority of nondegree-granting institutions were grouped by their largest program. The largest program was based on the largest program identified by the cipcode, that the institution reported on the student cost section of the institutional characteristics component. The programs are business (52), communications and communication technologies(09,10), cosmetology(12.04), engineering and engineering technologies(14,15) , manufacturing, construction, repair, and transportation (46,47,48,49) and health (51). All other cipcodes were combined for the other programs category. 

When the above methodolgy yielded small comparison groups (< 4 schools), groups of different controls maybe combined or a 4-year primarily associates maybe combined with a 4-year baccalaureate and above group. 

When the above methodology yielded large groups (greater than 40), groups were further subdivided by size, based on 12-month enrollment, (See cosmetology groups above). 

Special groups were made for the Tribal colleges, U.S. service institutions, and institutions in other jurisdictions, such as Puerto Rico.
